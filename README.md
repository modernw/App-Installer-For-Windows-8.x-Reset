Attention:

- This program is an x86 program, not an ARM application, not cross-platform, and cannot be used on Windows RT.

- This program uses some third-party libraries and other Github projects, and is completed using AI (ChatGTP). This project can be used for learning and communication purposes.
  
- (Important) Internet Explorer must support TLS 1.2 (requiring the use of IE's XMLHttpRequest to retrieve update information), especially IE10. You can do this by opening the "Advanced" tab in Control Panel/Internet Explorer's "Internet Options," finding "Use TLS 1.2" and checking the box, then clicking "OK" and saving. The settings will take effect the next time you open the browser.
